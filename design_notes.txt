Scope:
-------
Edge case of the pods being down when we attempt to get statistics, in this case we could try to do a redeployment - but too much work and off topic for this project in my view
for simplicity purposes, we will keep the hybrid autoscaler pod as a singl epod

Hybrid AutoScaler
------------------
Could be an application that is itself a pod in the same cluster
Will have multiple applications (i.e. containers within the same pod)
Keep it simple, single point of failure
Have a database backend (most likely redis)
Will use labels in pods ro


Data Layer:
------------
Most likely a redis database - nice and simple and no cost.
Performance not a factor here
Archiving???
