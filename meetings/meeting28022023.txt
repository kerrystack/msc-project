Subsection - Research Question?
High level question related to everything you have described in intro
Bit of context based on what you have described

Think about that question in  a hierarchical question (breaking question down into smaller parts)
Getting more specific!
More specific question on how performat is Kubernetes on autoscaling?
What are the alternate means of autoscaling
Where are they appropriate
What are limitations
Examples of questions?????

Almost like a guide
Going from more abstract to specific


Opening pieces of related of related work should focus on abstract piece
How performant is Kubernets for supporting Microservices
Experiments with 

Summarize the picture in relation to what you have read (Related work)
 - 


Goal: Ensure that you are familiar that metrics that are recorded, know how to measure?
Contextualize with the priorwork under that light
Comes out with the later work
Contextualizing and from that you are identifying the limitations and the methodology

Then when we go onto vertical scaling and horizontal scaling (subscetions)
Tables are good for comparison

1. Finish the intro (longer version of the abstract - the sell)
2. Stab at the research questions

If you are doing the related work, capture the methodology!
Measuring your methododology

How hard would it be to do this?????
We will base implementation on something others did (same as paper blah)
