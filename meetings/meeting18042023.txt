Comparable to other work, forms a baseline
Answer the 
Nothing for the use cases 
Listing those experiments and the variance of what Im investigating
Automate it - plot results (Thats starting point)
We need that working so we can start other things quickly
What are you limiting it to (I am being specific) - needs to be reviewed and tested - 
Set protocol now (hypothesis, run it)
Review the results
Create a visual that correlates number of pods with number of requests
We will tear apart the experiments (pytho script) (legend)

experiment1 - correlation between horizontal pods
 - configuration
 - parameters
have hierarchy depicted) - common configuration details

experimental protocol
hypothesis

No es un buen comienzo
