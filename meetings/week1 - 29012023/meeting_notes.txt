Core problems
-----------------
Good reasons for sending in bulk - just the issue?
Dont over focus on a particular solution at point in tim
need a good problem definition - capacity to demonstrate this problem
good to differentiate from work - abstract the problem
build an mvp - how difficult it is to do?
base system to demonstrate the work
stick with free tier - model the problem
where are the pain points in the process
all for reading up on theory - cost functions

technical competency
theoretical - generating the abstract description of problem and factors of the problem


week 1 mvp (fail and fail fast)
you have applied problem. demonstrate how 
focus more on the problem - 

try to develop the problem statement, break it down (there could be smaller questions to each of them
 - specify what


create an overleaf project
share the project with ruari
access to document?

zotoro
bibliography mamangment????
org

lit review - no point discussing yet
ruairi 
it will take a day to do this?


next week
 - get bitsand pieces setup (send on report)
 - try to rewrite the problem (workflow perspective 2 or 3 issues - focus on some of it), understand what each means
 - play around with free tier k8s thing
 - line chart - fake application ()
