Can I demonstrate the problem with horizontal and vertical scaling
Focus on one problem - e.g. vertical (see what limitations are?)
Simple workflow to automate as much as possible) (Veritical scaling in Kubernets lis limited by blah blah blah)
 - tHE RE are a number of potential solutions

Look at vertical scaling problem
Look at horizontal scaling problem (in isolation)
Break the problem down
Dont ignore the ones in isolation (they could be more informative)

Might loook at research in isolation?

Specify the types of applications in previous studies?
Taxconomy of sample applications

Mapping out apps, wht they are
Why the require hor and vert
In isolation will help
Why it needs compute, 




2 things:

Practical
------------
1. Get that cluster up and running to focus on existing infra, get comfortable - 
 - Be cognisant of solutions that are available (look at pre-canned solutions)
 -Get comfortable

Theoritical
----------------
Concentrate on top box
Review existing papers, what methodology did they use
Here is their use case - sample application
Hes is sample apps
Here is increase in volume
Here is how they are pulling metrics etc?
Response time?

Table that captures this work - study
Commonality across different study
Are the result comparable across them?
Common things found are good, should influence how I 

Start writing

Do we have a definition of a kubernetes cluster? etc
We need to define exactly what we are looking at
When looking at papers, look at contribution, challenges, what was the reason
