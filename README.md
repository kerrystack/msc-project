# msc-project
This repo contains all of the code and sme accompanying notes / design documents for my Msc Project

## Synopsis of project
The project concentrates on the creation of a novel hybrid autoscaler that can scale both vertically and horizontally, depending on the workload. The autoscaler has the following characteristics:
 - Works with applications that have consistent predictable resource usage over time
 - Is proactive, predicts ahead of time and sets up scaling jobs in advance
 - Possibility of using some AI techniques to predict ahead of time
